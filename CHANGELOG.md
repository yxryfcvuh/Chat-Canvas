# Changelog

All notable changes to Chat Canvas will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Local chat log saving**: automatically save player chat messages to `.minecraft/chatcanvas/chat-logs/` in UTF-8 JSONL format, isolated per world/server.
- Chat log settings page in editor (enable/disable, toggle self/others, command system channel, retention days, max file size, open directory).
- Asynchronous single-threaded log writer with bounded queue, daily file rotation, and size-based rotation.
- Chat log retention manager: automatically deletes log files older than configured days.
- Sensitive command exclusion for chat logs (reuses existing `SensitiveCommandDetector`).
- Session context switching (JOIN/DISCONNECT) for correct per-world/server log directories.
- Stable directory hashing (SHA-256) with sanitised display names to prevent path traversal.

### Changed

- Updated `README.md` and `README_EN.md` for all v1.2.0 features: dual channels, emoji, voice input, command tools, chat log, split layout, updated category count and data file paths.
- Bumped version to 1.2.0.

### Fixed

- **Voice key release Mixin crash**: Removed invalid `@Inject(method = "keyReleased")` from `ChatScreenMixin` — `ChatScreen` does not declare this method in Minecraft 1.21.1. Replaced with `KeyboardMixin` listening on GLFW `Keyboard.onKey` for a true GLFW_RELEASE event.
- **Microphone Lease concurrency** NPE (`this.opened is null`): Rewrote `MicrophoneManager.Lease.close()` using `AtomicReference<OpenedMicrophone>` with atomic `getAndSet(null)` to guarantee exactly-once close across concurrent capture, finish, cancel, and recognition threads.
- **Voice session cleanup**: Unified `VoiceInputSession` cleanup in a single `finally` block; made `finish()`/`cancel()` use CAS for safe one-shot signalling; made END marker enqueue idempotent via `endEnqueued` guard.
- **Error classification**: `IllegalStateException` from an already-closed lease no longer shows the misleading "microphone access" error.
- Voice input crash: replaced `ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy` with `DiscardOldestPolicy` to prevent `RejectedExecutionException` when microphone test or previous session occupied the capture thread.
- Keyboard voice recognition slowness: key repeat no longer overwrites `keyboardHolding` flag, so `finish()` is correctly called on key release instead of recording until timeout.
- Keyboard voice unresponsiveness when previous session was still in RECOGNIZING state: now cancels stale session before starting a new one on V press.

### Compatibility

- Chat Heads
- More Chat History
- ChatAnimation
- Smooth Scrolling

### Privacy

- Voice recognition runs entirely offline on the local machine.
- Audio is never uploaded or persisted to disk.
- Local chat log saving can be disabled per category in the editor.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect right/bottom coordinates in the Minecraft-style selection indicator renderer causing a large opaque gray rectangle across the editor preview when the settings panel was positioned on the right side.
- Fixed Minecraft-style category, alignment and background-mode selection indicators drawing outside their parent controls.
- Added `ModernUiTheme.transparentButton()` for hit-target buttons that should never draw a solid background in either theme.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Selectable Chat Canvas and Minecraft-style editor visual themes.
- Runtime theme switching without losing unsaved settings, undo history or current category.
- Persistent editor theme preference across game restarts.
- Theme-aware controls: labels, panels, tabs, numeric scrubbers, text fields and footer.
- Dedicated theme selection button in the editor header.

### Changed

- Reworked the Minecraft-style interface from a separate screen into a **visual theme** of the main Chat Canvas editor. Both themes share the same layout, preview, controls, EditorSession and EditorHistory.
- Updated the editor header layout to accommodate the theme button (toolbar widened to 460 px).
- Completed Minecraft-style visuals for setting labels, numeric scrubbers, selection indicators and the footer.
- Rewrote Chinese (`README.md`) and English (`README_EN.md`) documentation for v1.1.0.

### Fixed

- Theme button text overlapping the Undo button.
- Incomplete Minecraft-style theme colours leaving purple labels and blue accents visible in the vanilla theme.
- Numeric scrubber controls retaining modern-theme visuals (blue progress bar, dark panel) in the Minecraft-style theme.
- Category tab selected state using modern-theme blue highlights in the vanilla theme.
- Command clipboard launcher button remaining visible and interactive while the clipboard panel was open.
- Invisible command launcher hitbox blocking panel input after the clipboard opened.
- Theme switching previously creating a separate full-screen editor layout rather than swapping visual skins.
