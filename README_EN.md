Chat Canvas is a **client-side only** chat enhancement mod for **Minecraft 1.21.1 Fabric**.

Drag, resize and preview your chat overlay directly in-game while customising text styles, backgrounds, player name colours, @‑mention alerts, Emoji, command tools, voice input, and chat log saving — all in real time.

Chat Canvas ships with **two selectable editor visual themes** that share the same layout, features and configuration — only the UI controls change their appearance.

## Two Editor Visual Themes

Chat Canvas provides two **visual themes** for the editor — they are **not** two different editors. Both themes:

- Use the exact same editor layout
- Offer the exact same features
- Read and write the same configuration file
- Share the same editing session (EditorSession)
- Share the same undo / redo history
- Never lose unsaved changes when switching
- Only change the appearance of buttons, panels, sliders and text controls

### Chat Canvas Theme

- Semi‑transparent modern panels
- Rounded corners, shadows and custom controls
- Blue and purple accent colours
- Custom numeric scrubbers
- For players who prefer a modern UI

### Minecraft‑style Theme

- Minecraft‑style buttons, borders, sliders and text fields
- Square edges and vanilla grey visuals
- The exact same editor layout and features
- For players who prefer an appearance that matches the vanilla game

> **How to switch:** Click the "UI Theme" button in the editor header — your preference is saved automatically.

---

## Dual Chat Channels

Chat Canvas separates chat into two independent channels:

| Channel | Description |
|---|---|
| **Player Chat** | Normal player messages, mentions, whispers, etc. |
| **Command &amp; System** | Command results, system notifications, join/leave, death messages, etc. |

Both channels:
- Have independent position, size, text style and background settings

- Can be edited separately in the editor
- The command system channel supports text outline and customisable fade time

---

---

## Player Quick Actions

**Right‑click** a player name in chat to:

- **Mention player**: insert `@playername`
- **Whisper player**: using a configurable template (`/msg {player}`, `/tell {player}`, `/w {player}`)
- **Copy player name**

> All quick actions only modify the chat input field — they never send messages automatically.

---

## Command Tools

A "Commands" button appears next to the chat input field (or press Ctrl+F). Click it to open the command tools panel:

- **Recent**: executed commands sorted by time
- **Favorites**: saved frequently‑used commands, drag to reorder
- **Clipboard**: command candidates from system clipboard
- **Search** by name or command text
- **Edit / Delete / Reorder** favorites
- Insert at **cursor position** or **replace the entire input**
- Shift‑click to temporarily invert the insert mode
- **Sensitive command exclusion**: automatically filters `/login`, `/register`, `/password`, etc.
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletion or clearing
- Data persists across worlds, servers and restarts
- **Commands are never executed automatically**

---

## Emoji Picker

An "Emoji" button appears next to the chat input field. Click it to open the emoji panel:

- **10 categories**: Faces, People, Animals, Food, Activities, Travel, Objects, Symbols, Hearts, Recent
- **Search** by name
- **Recent history** persists across sessions
- Click an emoji to insert at cursor position
- Displays grapheme cluster count and input length limit
- Compatible with Chinese, English and Unicode

---

## Voice Input

Hold **V** (default keybind) for voice input, powered by local offline Vosk Chinese speech recognition:

- **Fully local** — no internet required
- Chinese voice model (vosk‑model‑small‑cn‑0.22, ~42 MB)
- Model download, installation and release
- Microphone selection and testing
- Configurable max recording seconds and noise threshold
- Input level meter and partial recognition display
- Auto‑append final punctuation
- Results inserted at cursor position
- Privacy: audio is never uploaded or saved

> Note: You need to download the Chinese voice model on first use. The microphone is only active while the key is held.

---

## Chat Log Saving

Automatically saves player chat messages to local files:

- Save location: `.minecraft/chatcanvas/chat-logs/`
- **Isolated per world/server** directories
- Directory names include stable hashes to prevent path traversal
- File format: UTF‑8 JSON Lines (`.jsonl`), one message per line
- Automatic daily file rotation with size‑based rotation
- **Asynchronous writing** — no game lag
- Player chat saved by default; self / others can be toggled independently
- Command &amp; system messages default to off, can be enabled separately
- Sensitive commands (e.g. `/login`, `/register`) are always excluded
- Configurable retention days (0 = keep forever)
- One‑click open chat logs directory

---

## Configuration &amp; Data Files

Settings are stored locally on your client:

| File | Path |
|---|---|
| Main config | `.minecraft/config/chat_canvas.json` |
| Command tools | `.minecraft/config/chat_canvas/commands.json` |
| Emoji recent | `.minecraft/config/chat_canvas/emoji.json` |
| Voice settings | `.minecraft/config/chatcanvas/voice.json` |
| Voice model | `.minecraft/config/chatcanvas/voice-models/` |
| Chat logs | `.minecraft/chatcanvas/chat-logs/` |
| Chat log settings | `.minecraft/config/chatcanvas/chatlog.json` |

- Switching worlds or servers does not lose your settings
- Delete the main config file to reset all settings
- Back up before modifying
- Manual editing during play is not recommended
- Corrupted configs are backed up and replaced with defaults automatically

---

## Compatibility

### Chat Heads

Chat Canvas does not provide player avatars. With Chat Heads installed, avatars display normally and participate in text width, background and alignment calculations. Double‑click and right‑click only respond to the player name, not the avatar area.

### More Chat History

Chat Canvas does not alter the chat history size — More Chat History handles that.

### ChatAnimation

Chat Canvas does not provide message entry animations — ChatAnimation does.

### Smooth Scrolling

Chat Canvas does not implement scroll animation — Smooth Scrolling provides it.

> Behaviour may differ across mod combinations, resource packs, custom fonts, GUI Scales and large modpacks.

---

## Security Notice

> [!WARNING]
> Command tools and chat logs store data as **local plain‑text JSON**. **Do not save passwords, tokens or private information** on shared or untrusted computers — for example, `/login`, `/register`, `/password`.

- Chat Canvas **never uploads** your commands or chat logs
- Data is never sent to the author or third parties
- Clicking a command **only fills the input field** — it never executes automatically
- Commands are only processed after you press Enter
- A plain‑text storage warning is shown when saving commands containing sensitive keywords
- Voice recognition runs entirely locally; audio is never uploaded
- You are responsible for what you choose to save

---

## Known Limitations

1. Currently supports Fabric 1.21.1 only
2. Client‑side only — no Forge or NeoForge version
3. Does not provide player avatars (use Chat Heads)
4. Does not provide message entry animations (use ChatAnimation)
5. Does not provide scroll animations (use Smooth Scrolling)
6. Some server plugins that convert player messages to system messages may strip sender UUIDs
7. Player colour and quick actions may not work when player identity cannot be determined
8. Custom fonts may alter text width, wrapping and click hit‑testing
9. Specialised chat‑format mods may require additional compatibility work
10. Whisper commands are server‑dependent — `/msg` may not be available
11. Command permissions are determined by the server — Chat Canvas cannot bypass them
12. Voice recognition supports Chinese only and requires a separate model download
13. Hold‑to‑talk via V key may be unstable in some environments; use mouse click on the mic button as a fallback

## FAQ

### How do I open the editor?

Press **K** (default) or use the Mod Menu config button. The keybind can be changed in Minecraft's Controls menu.

### How do I switch between themes?

Click the "UI Theme" button in the editor header and select your preferred theme.

### Will switching themes lose my changes?

No. Switching only changes visual control styles. All unsaved edits, undo history and your current category tab are preserved.

### Why don't I see a Mod Menu config entry?

Make sure Mod Menu is installed. Chat Canvas registers its entry automatically.

### Why do some player names lack automatic colours?

If the server converts player messages to system messages, the sender UUID may be lost, making colour assignment impossible.

### Why doesn't double‑clicking a name insert a mention?

Ensure "Double‑click mention" is enabled in the Mentions settings, and that you double‑click within the configured time interval.

### Why does the command button disappear when the panel opens?

This is by design. The launcher button hides while the tools panel is open so it does not obstruct the panel. It reappears when you close the panel.

### Why doesn't clicking a command execute it immediately?

Chat Canvas only fills the input field. You must press Enter to send — this keeps you in control.

### How do I use voice input?

Hold the **V** key while speaking, then release. On first use, download the Chinese voice model from the Voice settings page. You can also click the microphone icon next to the chat field.

### Where are chat logs saved?

`.minecraft/chatcanvas/chat-logs/`, organised by world/server in JSONL format.

### Why aren't commands in my chat log?

Command and system messages are not saved by default. Enable "Save Command & System Messages" in the Chat Log settings category.

### Does Chat Canvas need to be installed on the server?

No. It is client‑side only.

### Does it support Forge / NeoForge?

The current version supports Fabric 1.21.1 only.

## Troubleshooting

1. Verify Minecraft version is 1.21.1
2. Verify Fabric Loader is installed
3. Verify Fabric API and owo‑lib are installed
4. Back up `config/chat_canvas.json` and related config directories
5. Temporarily rename config files to test for corruption
6. Test with only Chat Canvas and its required dependencies
7. Re‑enable other mods in batches to isolate conflicts
8. Check custom fonts and resource packs
9. Provide `latest.log`, mod list, screenshots and reproduction steps when reporting
